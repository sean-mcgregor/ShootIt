# ShootIt
ShootIt! Android application for photographers. Developed by Sean McGregor (C18426032) for Fourth Year Project.

This application uses Google Maps API and OpenWeatherMap API to run. These services require API keys which, for security reasons, I have not included in the GitHub commits. The source code can be viewed and analysed by cloning the main branch of this repository, however if you wish to run ShootIt! on your Android device, please download and install the compiled APK file, which can be found under the most recent release in the release section.
