# ShootIt
ShootIt! Android application for photographers. Developed by Sean McGregor (C18426032) for Fourth Year Project.

This application uses Google Maps API and OpenWeatherMap API to run. These services require API keys which, for security reasons, I have not included in the GitHub commits. The source code can be viewed and analysed by cloning the main branch of this repository, however if you wish to run ShootIt! on your Android device, please download and install the compiled APK file, which can be found under the most recent release in the release section.

Please also note that the application can only be run on physical devices, and not the Android emulator included in Android Studio. This is due to the fact that the emulator lacks the Google Play Services required. Also please launch the application while using LIGHT MODE on your device. A dark mode will be available for ShootIt! soon, but currently using light mode is the best way to experience the application.
